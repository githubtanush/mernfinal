    Hello jee
    <script src="01_script.js">
    </script>
</body>

<!-- you can add script tag in head and body anywhere but best practice is that u add the code at the last of the body tag so  -->
<!-- that all the things render before scripting because if scripting start then it may be possible that function takes more time  -->
<!-- so that to do them in less time u add script tag in last so that all things render before start-->
